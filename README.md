# ðŸŽ“ Scanvas

**Scanvas** is a smart web-based tool that automates the process of taking attendance in classrooms by combining **computer vision** with the **Canvas LMS API**.

Instead of manually entering student attendance, instructors can simply upload a **photo of a handwritten attendance sheet**, and Scanvas will:
1. Extract student IDs using **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**
2. Match those IDs to enrolled students in a Canvas course
3. Automatically mark them as "present" via a designated **attendance assignment** using the **Canvas REST API**
